      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üìñ Introduction to the World Wide Web</h2>
      <p>
        The World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypertext-based information system that interlinks documents stored across
        millions of machines on the Internet. It was introduced by CERN in 1989 to facilitate collaboration among
        physicists worldwide. Tim Berners-Lee proposed the concept, leading to the development of the first text-based
        prototype. The introduction of the graphical browser Mosaic in 1993 significantly boosted the web's popularity.

    <!-- Section: Client-Server Communication -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üîÑ Client-Server Communication</h2>
      <p>
        In the WWW, clients request resources from servers, which respond accordingly. This interaction is facilitated
        through APIs. Understanding the underlying protocols is essential for effective API design.
      </p>

    <!-- Section: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üì° Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2>
      <p>
        HTTP is the foundational protocol of the web, enabling the transfer of hypertext documents. It operates on a
        request-response model, where clients send requests and servers provide responses. HTTP has evolved over time,
        with versions like HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 improving performance and efficiency.
      </p>

    <!-- Section: Evolution of HTTP -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üìà Evolution of HTTP</h2>
      <p>
        HTTP has undergone several iterations to enhance web communication. HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections
        and chunked transfer encoding. HTTP/2 brought multiplexing and header compression, reducing latency. These
        advancements have significantly improved the efficiency of data exchange on the web.

    <!-- Section: Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üß© Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)</h2>
      <p>
        RPCs allow a program to execute procedures on a remote server as if they were local calls. This abstraction
        simplifies distributed computing. However, it also introduces challenges like network latency and error
        handling, which must be carefully managed in API design.
      </p>

    <!-- Section: WebSockets -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üîå WebSockets</h2>
      <p>
        WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data
        exchange between clients and servers. This is particularly useful for applications requiring instant updates,
        such as chat apps or live feeds.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Strategic API Design:</strong> Align API development with business goals, ensuring scalability and
          maintainability.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocol Selection:</strong> Choose appropriate communication protocols (HTTP, WebSockets, RPC)
          based on application requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect
          data integrity and privacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Monitor and optimize API performance, addressing bottlenecks and
          ensuring efficient data handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation and Standards:</strong> Maintain comprehensive API documentation and adhere to
          industry standards for consistency and ease of use.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Leadership:</strong> Mentor team members, promote best practices, and foster a culture of
          continuous improvement in API development.</li>
