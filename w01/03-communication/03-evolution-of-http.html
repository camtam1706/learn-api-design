        <span>üìò HTTP/0.9</span>
      </h2>
      <p>Introduced in 1991, HTTP/0.9 was the first version of the protocol. It was a simple client-server and
        request-response protocol supporting only the GET method. Responses consisted solely of raw HTML, without
        headers or status codes. Connections were closed immediately after sending the response.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold flex items-center space-x-2">
        <span>üìò HTTP/1.0</span>
      </h2>
      <p>Released in 1996, HTTP/1.0 introduced support for HTTP header fields, allowing for metadata in requests and
        responses. This version supported multiple methods like GET, POST, and HEAD, enabling the transfer of various
        content types beyond just HTML. However, it lacked persistent connections, leading to inefficiencies in handling
        multiple requests.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold flex items-center space-x-2">
        <span>üìò HTTP/1.1</span>
      </h2>
      <p>Published in 1997, HTTP/1.1 brought significant improvements, including persistent connections, pipelining, and
        additional cache control mechanisms. It also introduced support for methods like PUT, DELETE, and OPTIONS,
        enhancing its capability to handle a wider range of operations.</p>

        <span>üìò HTTP/2</span>
      </h2>
      <p>Released in 2015, HTTP/2 shifted from a text-based to a binary protocol, improving performance through features
        like multiplexing, header compression, and server push. These enhancements reduced latency and allowed for more
        efficient use of network resources.</p>

        <span>üìò HTTP/3</span>
      </h2>
      <p>Introduced in 2019, HTTP/3 is based on QUIC, a transport protocol built over UDP. It aims to reduce latency and
        improve performance, especially in high-loss or high-latency networks. HTTP/3 also offers better multiplexing
        and header compression, further enhancing the efficiency of web communications.</p>

      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
        <li><strong>Protocol Selection:</strong> Choose the appropriate HTTP version based on the specific needs of your
          application, considering factors like performance, security, and compatibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Versioning Strategy:</strong> Implement a clear versioning strategy to manage changes and ensure
          backward compatibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Leverage features like multiplexing and header compression in
          HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 to optimize performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Considerations:</strong> Ensure secure communication by utilizing protocols that support
          encryption and other security features.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Design your systems to handle increased load efficiently, taking advantage of
          persistent connections and other scalability features in newer HTTP versions.</li>
