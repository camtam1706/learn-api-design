      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">📘 What is API Design?</h2>
      <p>
        API design involves carefully planning and developing programming interfaces to expose data and system
        functionality to consumers. Effective API design addresses key questions such as the purpose of the API, its
        intended outcomes, design approach, resource structure, and documentation strategy.

    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">🎯 Why Does API Design Matter?</h2>
      <p>
        APIs are products that facilitate system-to-system communication. Poorly designed APIs can lead to user
        dissatisfaction and abandonment. Therefore, it's crucial to design APIs that meet end-user requirements and
        align with business goals.

    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">🔄 API Design Lifecycle</h2>
      <p>
        The API development lifecycle mirrors that of other products, starting with design based on functional and
        non-functional requirements. Developers expect APIs to be simple, helpful, and easy to adopt, necessitating a
        thoughtful design process.

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">🛠️ Design-First vs. Code-First Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The code-first approach begins with coding based on business requirements, with documentation generated later.
        In contrast, the design-first approach starts with creating the API's contract or specification before coding,
        allowing for early feedback and adjustments.

    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">🧠 API Design Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Key considerations in API design include identifying potential users and their relationship with the business,
        which influences access levels and authentication methods. Additionally, choosing the appropriate architectural
        style (e.g., REST, gRPC) is essential.
