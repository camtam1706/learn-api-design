      <p>
        The internet adopts a layered architecture to manage the complexity of data transmission across diverse systems.
        Each layer has a specific function, providing services to the layer above and receiving services from the layer
        below. This modularity allows for easier troubleshooting and flexibility in accommodating various applications.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">🎯 The "Narrow Waist" Concept</h2>
      <p>
        The term "narrow waist" refers to the Internet Protocol (IP) layer, which serves as a universal protocol
        enabling diverse applications above and various network technologies below. By standardizing on IP, the internet
        allows for innovation at the application and network levels without requiring changes to the core protocol.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">🔒 Importance of HTTP and Firewalls</h2>
      <p>
        Most public-facing APIs use HTTP over TCP/IP because it's widely supported and can traverse firewalls that often
        block unfamiliar protocols. Attempting to use custom protocols over raw IP packets is typically unsuccessful due
        to such network restrictions.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">📚 Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The internet's layered architecture, with IP at its core, facilitates interoperability and innovation.
        Understanding this structure is crucial for effective API design, ensuring compatibility and accessibility
        across diverse systems.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Protocol Selection:</strong> Choose protocols that are widely supported and firewall-friendly, like
          HTTP over TCP/IP.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implement robust security measures, including TLS, to protect data in transit.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Design APIs that can handle increasing loads without performance degradation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Provide clear and comprehensive documentation to facilitate integration and
          maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Set up monitoring and logging to track API usage and detect issues promptly.
        </li>
