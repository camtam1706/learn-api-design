      <p>
        Traditional HTTP protocols are not ideal for real-time applications like instant messaging or live streaming due
        to their request-response nature. Techniques like short polling and long polling have limitations, such as
        unnecessary requests and inefficient connections. Event-driven architecture (EDA) addresses these issues by
        allowing clients to receive data automatically when events occur, eliminating the need for constant polling.

      <p>
        EDA focuses on events to drive data and application behavior. Clients subscribe to specific topics and receive
        updates when events are triggered, without explicitly requesting data. This asynchronous approach contrasts with
        traditional REST APIs and enhances scalability and responsiveness.

    <!-- Types of Event-Driven Protocols -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üîå Types of Event-Driven Protocols</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Webhooks:</strong> Server-side callbacks that notify clients about events by sending HTTP POST
          requests to a specified URL. Commonly used for real-time notifications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Server-Sent Events (SSE):</strong> Allows servers to push updates to clients over a single HTTP
          connection. Suitable for applications like live feeds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>WebSub (Pub-Sub):</strong> A publish-subscribe protocol where clients subscribe to topics and receive
          updates when events occur. Enhances decoupling between publishers and subscribers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>WebSocket:</strong> Enables full-duplex communication between client and server over a single,
          persistent connection. Ideal for real-time applications like chat systems.
        </li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üß† Considerations for Senior/Lead Engineers</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Protocol Selection:</strong> Choose the appropriate event-driven protocol based on application
          requirements, scalability needs, and client capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security:</strong> Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure event channels and
          prevent unauthorized access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Design robust error-handling strategies to manage failures in event delivery
          and processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong> Establish comprehensive monitoring and logging to track event flows,
          detect anomalies, and facilitate debugging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalability:</strong> Ensure the architecture can handle increased load by leveraging scalable
          infrastructure and load balancing techniques.
        </li>
